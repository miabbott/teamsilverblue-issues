And possibly examples of each of these problems needs their own silverblue issue rather than as bug reports. So it isn't any sort of deal killer to have autohide enabled, I just find it's more of a burden and premature while so many things are not stable yet.",

There are too many things related to partitioning, bootloader, assembly and startup and this polish feature I'm finding to be a hindrance in testing. \r\n\r\nI find the feature enabled in Workstation here:\r\nhttps://github.com/rhinstaller/anaconda/blob/master/pyanaconda/installclasses/fedora_workstation.py\r\n\r\nBut I'm not finding a silverblue specific install class, so I'm guessing silverblue is using the workstation one because my recent silverblue 29 installs definitely hide the grub menu.",
