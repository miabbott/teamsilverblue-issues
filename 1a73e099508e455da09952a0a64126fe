Do we have a way to calculate how much this will increase the size requirement for the live image? (I'm not so concerned about install footprint, but the live image should remain relatively small.)",

The shipped `vi` however is damn annoying due to all the deviations to `vim`, which often cause serious headaches (and I don\u2019t know of a single user actually using `vi`). As `vim` pulls in a lot of dependencies, I understand that you don\u2019t want to ship that \u2013 but `neovim` in contrast is pretty slim and just pulls in 5,7 MB. So I propose to go on in time and switch from `vi` to `neovim` \u2013 what do you think? :grin: ",
