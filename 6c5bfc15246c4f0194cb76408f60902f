    "content": "I'm currently doing a test install of Silverblue 29 beta 1.5 in a virtual machine. In the test day documentation I ran across these manual partitioning instructions: https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/fedora-silverblue/installation-guide/#manual-partition. Since it's a virtual machine, I opted for a custom partitioning so I could look at what the automatic partitioner was generating.\r\n\r\nIt turns out that it is generating an LVM partitioning with `swap`, a `/boot`, a `/`, and a `/home`. But the manual partitioning setup uses `/var/home`! So who's right - Anaconda's automatic partitioner or the manual partitioning directions? Or does the Silverblue 29 installer do the symlinking for me? I changed `/home` to `/var/home`. Was I wrong?",
