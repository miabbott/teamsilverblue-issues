And investigating this actually uncovered some issues I hadn't really thought through before. Anyway, upstreamed here: https://github.com/projectatomic/rpm-ostree/issues/1843.\r\n\r\nThe tl;dr though is there's no good way to do this right now other than removing yourself from `/etc/group` and running it as root for now.",
