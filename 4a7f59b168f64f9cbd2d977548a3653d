This currently works fine if we install Fedora Workstation using netinstall method which also offers \"Language Support\" but same is not available on Live iso, hence not possible to get langpacks auto-installed. I guess then same for OSTree here. Its not coming with pre-packaged `langpacks-<langcode>` meta-package?",
