    "content": "I have a plug-in USB WiFi adapter (Ralink Technology, Corp. RT5372 Wireless Adapter). I can set up my phone as a hotspot and connect to it from the workstation. But when I try to set up the adapter as a hotspot itself in the WiFi setting, it creates the hotspot, but it crashes. And once it's been created, it keeps trying and crashing.\r\n\r\nThere's already an issue in Bugzilla for this: https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1591162. I have the same issue on Fedora 29 beta, so if it makes more sense to troubleshoot it there, let me know.\r\n\r\nThere are two `wpa_supplicant.conf` files, one in `dbus-1/system.d` and one in `/etc/wpa_supplicant`. I've attached both of them, and a `journalctl` log. I'm guessing this is a configuration file problem; the adapter works on other distros with this kernel.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!!image>\r\n<!!image>\r\n<!!image>\r\n",
