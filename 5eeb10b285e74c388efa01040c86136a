That's what you should be doing anyways even on [\"classic\" Fedora](https://pagure.io/Fedora-Council/tickets/issue/208).  Example: A developer wants to use Silverblue as a desktop but build applications in Python that target RHEL7.  Great!  They can use a RHEL7 container, which works the same as a Fedora container.\r\n",

When a venv (semi-isolated Python environment) is bootstrapped, `pip` (the package installer) is installed into it. Python normally bundles pip as a *wheel* (the Python-native distribution format), but Fedora unbundles this \u2013 it's a compiled blob upstream, and it's a needless duplicate of bits already present on disk. Instead, we use *rewheel* (a Fedora-specific thing) to pack the RPM-installed pip back into a *wheel*, and feed it to the normal installation machinery.\r\n\r\nWheels are a ZIP-based OS-independent format, and packing Silverblue stuff blows up with the `ZIP does not support timestamps before 1980` error.\r\n\r\nWe can possibly add some workaround to `rewheel`, but maybe this could be solved at a different level.\r\nHow important to Silverblue is having UNIX timestamps of zero?
