That's what you should be doing anyways even on [\"classic\" Fedora](https://pagure.io/Fedora-Council/tickets/issue/208).  Example: A developer wants to use Silverblue as a desktop but build applications in Python that target RHEL7.  Great!  They can use a RHEL7 container, which works the same as a Fedora container.\r\n",

    "content": "Silverblue sets the timestamp of files on disk to 1970-01-01, which can't be represented in ZIP files.\r\nThe `zip` utility seems to work around this limitation by silently bumping the timestamp to the first representable date, `1980-01-01 00:00:00`.\r\nPython's `zipfile` module doesn't have this workaround:\r\n```console\r\n$ python3 -m zipfile -c foo.zip /etc/os-release\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  ...\r\nValueError: ZIP does not support timestamps before 1980\r\n```\r\n(FWIW, I strongly prefer this to silently mangling data!)\r\n\r\nThis is a problem when bootstrapping Python virtual environments, mentioned in [Fedora bug 1599422](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1599422), the following does not work in Silverblue:\r\n```console\r\n$ python3 -m venv testing\r\nError: Command '['/tmp/testing/bin/python3', '-Im', 'ensurepip', '--upgrade', '--default-pip']' returned non-zero exit status 1.\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhat happens here? When a venv (semi-isolated Python environment) is bootstrapped, `pip` (the package installer) is installed into it. Python normally bundles pip as a *wheel* (the Python-native distribution format), but Fedora unbundles this \u2013 it's a compiled blob upstream, and it's a needless duplicate of bits already present on disk. Instead, we use *rewheel* (a Fedora-specific thing) to pack the RPM-installed pip back into a *wheel*, and feed it to the normal installation machinery.\r\n\r\nWheels are a ZIP-based OS-independent format, and packing Silverblue stuff blows up with the `ZIP does not support timestamps before 1980` error.\r\n\r\nWe can possibly add some workaround to `rewheel`, but maybe this could be solved at a different level.\r\nHow important to Silverblue is having UNIX timestamps of zero? Could it be bumped to 1980 or later, to enable zipping OS components properly?\r\n",
