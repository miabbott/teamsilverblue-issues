Since we still want to preinstall a useful set of applications, we need to be able to preinstall flatpaks.\r\n\r\nFrom a hallway discussion with Colin a while ago, this probably requires us to have a flatpak repository on the iso and install the apps from there.\r\n\r\nI've started some initial discussion on this here:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.redhat.com/archives/anaconda-devel-list/2018-April/msg00002.html\r\n\r\nEndless is working on p2p support for ostree and flatpak that will be useful for this.",
