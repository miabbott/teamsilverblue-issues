E.g.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ rpm-ostree override replace https://kojipkgs.fedoraproject.org//packages/podman/0.10.1.3/4.gitdb08685.fc29/x86_64/podman-0.10.1.3-4.gitdb08685.fc29.x86_64.rpm\r\n$ # some time later...\r\n$ rpm-ostree override reset podman\r\n```\r\n\r\n> I then typed `rpm-ostree install --allow-inactive buildah-1.5-1.gite94b4f9.fc29` which seemed to work\r\n\r\n This likely doesn't do what you want. It'll make sure that `buildah-1.5-1.gite94b4f9.fc29` is always installed in your tree. So on the next buildah bump, you'll get an error that `buildah-1.5-1.gite94b4f9.fc29` was not found in the repos (and if somehow it were found, you'd get conflicts with the builtin one).",

When I checked their version it would show the earlier version I  wanted to not use. So I did an rpm-ostree status to see if the packages were actually there, etc... anyway it showed them (podman and buildah) with their current up to date versions as inactive. So I thought to use --allow-inactive, although rpm-ostree balked at the switch/option. Yeah, i uninstalled the buildah rpm, then allowed the upgrade to go ahead.\r\nAs for the upgrade and new user thing, yes this is the third time it has happened to me personally, and there was another user I talked with on the Silverblue discussion site about it happening to them. I can access my original user afterwards, but I must go through the initial setup of another user to get there. The packages my original user had installed are all there less the layered ones, with the new user. The original user dotfiles, home, everything is still intact, so nothing lost. I suppose, I could have interrupted the bootup and gone directly to a prompt and logged in a terminal at start instead of Gnome. Then likely prevented this from happening by ???? creating a 'firstrundone' text file?",

It was not far enough back. \r\nSo I  have been going back as far as December 19 2018 version by guessing the version date and consequently number. I was wondering if there is a meta data file that hold info on the versions on my system. Also, could there be more than one version for a specific date, indicated by the last number .0 or .1 or some such? I have had success in getting back to those versions so far, just when I upgrade the issue doesn't happen yet. Also, I know for a fact that I had Podman and Buildah downgraded to specific versions for fedora-toolbox to work, would that have been part of the issue since it happened after I had tried to restore them to their proper release level due to the upgrade in fedora-toolbox (to 0.3). Something like dnf has with distro-sync would have been real nice.",

I was able to get back to the particular ostree image I was interested in, I just cannot get it to recreate the issue of first run after upgrade. Which makes me think it is likely something not part of the image itself, but the user system. Through the efforts of jogging my memory on the steps I executed that resulted in the issue noted, I realised that at least twice I had performed an rpm-ostree commit before rebooting into a previous commit. The last such time (in memory) podman was still at version 0.10.3 and still reporting nothing to reset with the override reset command. Buildah was for sure the rpm version I had downloaded (also noted above) and managed to get installed (through removing the base version). I know I had used ostree command's in the mix, but I remember that being for checking for the existing images, and no writing/committing function was ever used.\r\n[![Screenshot_from_2019-01-26_08-09-13.png](/teamsilverblue/issue/raw/files/3ece7c85257b7b4b735e7e5c4c3e5fcfa917614f9121db55a26c78ff47042930-Screenshot_from_2019-01-26_08-09-13.png)](/teamsilverblue/issue/raw/files/3ece7c85257b7b4b735e7e5c4c3e5fcfa917614f9121db55a26c78ff47042930-Screenshot_from_2019-01-26_08-09-13.png)\r\nThe screenshot above shows the output of both podman images and buildah images commands, done this morning before I continue trying. My point here is that I am pretty certain I was the creator of my issue as noted above, and so too were others likely that had the same problem. Having said that I am all for finding out what I did to avoid doing that specific thing again. In my day to day job there are times when the how is not as important as the why, which when applied to this issue brings me to the point that this approach to a workstation setup is new to a lot of us. Although I keep up to date on the newer technologies as they get rolled out, I am cognizant always that I generally don't employ most aspects of it at the levels of use that it was designed to be, and as a consequence misapply some commands likely, break some verboten rules (also likely) without realising it.",

            "comment": "> Unfortunately, if it's a subtle interaction of your system state in /etc and /var wrt the OSTree commit, it's possible indeed that it will be impossible to reproduce the issue. To confirm, other than the first user setup window, you didn't actually experience any data/config loss, right?\r\n\r\nNo loss of data, and the original user was intact right down to shell script's, et. al.\r\n> \r\n> The system journal is about the best you can do, esp. if it's something that happened a while ago already.\r\n\r\nI was doing a comparison between both the system and user journals, to try and piece together the steps (combined with the shell history file, and the rpm-ostree history). I think I should close this issue now, so as not to block any similar that may come along and be better diagnosed.",

    "content": "Late last year, I was using fedora-toolbox on Silverblue. After a podman/buildah update, my fedora-toolbox `broke`. So I talked with @rishi about it and was guided to override those two packages, which solved my issue with using my pet container. Recently, with the new upgrade to fedora-toolbox, I tried to reset those downgrades, beginning with buildah. So I used a command something like this 'rpm-ostree override reset buildah https://koji.fedoraproject.org/koji/buildinfo?buildID=1157063' which failed. I then typed 'rpm-ostree install --allow-inactive buildah-1.5-1.gite94b4f9.fc29\" which seemed to work, i did 'systemctl reboot'. On reboot I was faced with the first run user setup screen. I can repeat this, using a different package (podman in this case), which would seem to indicate it isn't related to those packages. This has also happened to me on an upgrade of Silverblue from F28 to F29.",
