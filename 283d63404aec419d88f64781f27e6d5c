But I think there's a wrinkle here: I think they're not intended to be removed, but are being removed because lorax thinks `${libdir}` is `lib` when it should be `lib64`. Note this from the logs:\r\n\r\n    removefrom libvorbis --allbut /usr/lib/libvorbisfile.* /usr/lib/libvorbis.*: removed 12/12 files, 2731kb/2731kb\r\n\r\nBut the line in `runtime-cleanup.tmpl` is:\r\n\r\n    removefrom libvorbis --allbut /usr/${libdir}/libvorbisfile.* /usr/${libdir}/libvorbis.*\r\n\r\nTagging @bcl on this, I'll look into it a bit.",
