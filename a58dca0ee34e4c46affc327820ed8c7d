In the default `Dockerfile` model, there is basically no usage of the host, and that's supported by `buildah bud`.  Now, it's definitely true that `buildah` was oriented around the idea of reusing the host tooling.  However, this has created a powerful tension with reproducibility.\r\n\r\n(It's also possible to use `buildah` from a container itself, though there are some tricks to that)",
