Link of latest Silverblue media to be tested will be added before Test Day.\r\n\r\nSome initial Silverblue Test cases has been created at http://testdays.fedorainfracloud.org/events/47 . @mclasen , @otaylor and others, can you please review them and see if existing test cases are ok? Also, can we have additional test cases (if any) listed in comment so that @sumantrom and other QA members can get additional test cases created as well?",
