    "content": "Hello.  I'm new to Fedora (and Linux in general,) and I've been playing around with Silverblue recently. I wanted the secondary drive in my system to mount automatically at startup because I noticed it wasn't. I used the Gnome disk utility, ungreyed the options and checked the box to automatically mount at startup. I also changed  \"identify as\" to a label I set for the drive rather than the random string of characters it used to be. To test it out, I rebooted system and was met with the \"F\" logo slowly filling up, but never quite making it. This usually works fine in the non-Silverblue Fedora workstations, but it seems bugged here. I can snap a pick of the output and post momentarily.",
